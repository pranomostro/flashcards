Defitinion Microeconomics	Analysis of individual choices and their interaction on markets
Definition Macroeconomics	Analysis of the economy as a whole
Fundamental Problem of economics	Scarce resource: Human wants exceed the resources available to satisfy them
Optimization definition	Rational individuals: / * maximize utility from a given set of resources / * minimize resource use to obtain a given utility level
Definition Equilibrium	A situation where individual choices are: / * optimal, no agent has an incentive to change behavior / * mutually compatible and therefore feasible
Definition Pareto improvement	Reallocation that makes at least one agent better off without making any other agent worse off
Definition Pareto efficiency	An allocation of resource where no pareto-improvement is possible
Definition Production	Transformation of inputs into outputs
Definition Trade	Voluntary exchange of goods between agents
Attributes Transformation Curve	All combinations on and below the transformation curve are feasible, and only the ones on the curve are efficient, expresses opportunity cost of good 1 to good 2
Definition Absolute Advantage	An agent's ability to produce a certain good using less resources than other agents
Definition Comparative Advantage	An agent's ability to produce a certain good at lower opportunity costs than other agents
Principle of Comparative Advantage	Specialization according to comparative advantages facilitates mutual gains from trade / (this is true whether or not one of the trading partners has absolute advantages on the production of every good).
Given prices p₁, p₂ as well as quantities q₁, q₂, how does one calculate the individual's budget y from them?	y=p₁*q₁+p₂*q₂

Assumptions on Preferences	Completeness (all goods are comparable), / Transitivity (if a>b∧b>c, then a>c), / Monotonicity (more of a and the same of b is worth equally much), / Convexity (the weighted average of the goods is worth more or equal)
Definition Completeness in Preferences	The agent can compare any two consumption bundles A and B
Definition Transitivity in Preferences	If the agent prefers A to B and B to C, then she also prefers A to C. Same holds for indifference. / → Indifference curves do not cross
Definition Monotonicity in Preferences	If the consumption bundle A contains a larger quantity of each good than the consumption bundle B, the individual prefers A to B / → Indifference curves for two goods are negatively sloped
Definition Convexity in Preferences	If an agent is indifferent between two consumption bundles A and B, then the weighted average of both is at least as good as A or B / → Indifference curves are convex
Definition Perfect Substitute	Two goods the individual is willing to substitute for one another at a constant rate / → Linear indifference curves
Definition Perfect Complements	Two goods the individual wants to consume in fixed proportions / → Orthogonal indifference curves
